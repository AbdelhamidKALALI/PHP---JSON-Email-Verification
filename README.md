PHP---JSON-Email-Verification
=============================

This is a short, simple, and straight forward script to perform some basic verification on a submitted email address. Can be used either as a PHP include/require or as a straight up URL with one GET variable so that one can use it with just about any other language such as JavaScript, etc

This has only been developed and tested on a CentOS Apache setup with PHP 5.4.21 .
